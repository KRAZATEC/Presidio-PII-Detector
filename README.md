## 📚 API Documentation

### Base URL
- **Local:** `http://localhost:8000`
- **Production:** `https://presidio-pii-detector-production.up.railway.app`

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Analyze Text
**POST** `/analyze`

Detect PII entities in text.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "text": "My name is John Smith and my email is john@example.com",
  "threshold": 0.5
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "PERSON",
      "start": 11,
      "end": 21,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "value": "John Smith"
    },
    {
      "entity": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
      "start": 40,
      "end": 62,
      "confidence": 0.99,
      "value": "john@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Mask Text
**POST** `/mask`

Redact PII entities from text.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "text": "My aadhar is 5647 3498 2848",
  "threshold": 0.5
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "masked": "My aadhar is XXXX XXXX XXXX"
}
```

#### 3. Upload and Analyze PDF
**POST** `/upload-pdf`

Extract text from PDF and detect PII.

**Request:**
- Form data with file upload

**Response:**
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "CREDIT_CARD",
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "value": "4532-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Confidence Threshold

**Purpose:** The confidence threshold controls the minimum confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) required for an entity to be reported as detected. This feature helps reduce false positives and improves detection accuracy.

**How It Works:**

- **Threshold Range:** Values range from 0.0 (accept all detections) to 1.0 (only accept perfect matches)
- **Default Value:** 0.5 (detects entities with 50% or higher confidence)
- **Impact on Detection:** Higher thresholds reduce false positives but may miss some legitimate PII; lower thresholds catch more entities but with higher false positive rates
- **Entity-Specific:** Each PII entity type has its own confidence score based on the underlying NLP model's certainty

**Usage Example:**

- Set threshold to **0.8+** for high-precision scenarios (fewer false positives, stricter filtering)
- Set threshold to **0.5-0.7** for balanced detection (default behavior)
- Set threshold to **0.3-0.5** for high-recall scenarios (catch more PII, accept more false positives)

**API Usage:**

When calling the `/analyze` or `/mask` endpoints, include the `threshold` parameter:

```json
{
  "text": "Contact me at john@example.com",
  "threshold": 0.8
}
```

Only entities with confidence >= 0.8 will be returned in the response.


### Detected Entities

- PERSON
- EMAIL_ADDRESS
- PHONE_NUMBER (Mobile Number - India)
- CREDIT_CARD
- BANK_ACCOUNT
- LOCATION
- PAN (Permanent Account Number - India)
- AADHAAR (Aadhaar Number - India)
- VOTER_ID (Voter ID - India)
- ORG_ID (Organization ID - Custom)

2. Click "+ New Project"
3. Select "GitHub Repo" and choose your Presidio-PII-Detector repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name:** Presidio-PII-Detector (or preferred name)
   - **Root Directory:** `/backend`
   - **Build Command:** (leave default)
   - **Start Command:** (leave default for Dockerfile)
   - **Port:** 8000

5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect the Dockerfile
   - Build the Docker image
   - Deploy the service

6. **Generate Public Domain:**
   - Go to Networking tab
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Set Port to 8000
   - Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://presidio-pii-detector-production.up.railway.app`)

#### 2. **Create Frontend Service**

1. In the same Railway project, click "+ Create"
2. Select "GitHub Repo" and select the same repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Name:** Frontend (or preferred name)
   - **Root Directory:** `/frontend`
   - **Builder:** Dockerfile
   - **Dockerfile Path:** `/frontend/Dockerfile`
   - **Port:** 80

4. Railway will automatically build and deploy

5. **Generate Public Domain:**
   - Go to Networking tab
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Set Port to 80
   - Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://presidio-pii-detector.up.railway.app`)

#### 3. **Update Frontend API Endpoint**

1. Open `frontend/script.js`
2. Update the API endpoint (line 3):
   ```javascript
   const API = "https://presidio-pii-detector-production.up.railway.app";
   ```
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add frontend/script.js
   git commit -m "Update backend URL for production"
   git push
   ```

4. Railway will automatically redeploy the frontend with the updated configuration

### Production URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

**Frontend:** https://presidio-pii-detector.up.railway.app/

**Backend API:** https://presidio-pii-detector-production.up.railway.app/

### Monitoring

On Railway dashboard, you can:
- View deployment logs
- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Check build history
- Scale instances
- Set environment variables

### Database Persistence

Railway supports database services if needed in the future. You can add:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

Connect them via environment variables in your Railway project.

---

🚀 Deploying to Other Platforms
-------------------------------
### Deploying to AWS (ECS Fargate Example)

1. **Build and push images**
   - Build images locally or in CI.
   - Push to Amazon ECR.

2. **Create ECS task definition**
   - Define containers for `backend` and `frontend` using your ECR images.
   - Set environment variables from AWS SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.

3. **Create ECS service**
   - Use Fargate launch type.
   - Attach an Application Load Balancer.
   - Map HTTP/HTTPS listeners to the frontend container port.

4. **Configure networking and domain**
   - Use a public subnet and security group allowing HTTP/HTTPS.
   - Point your domain to the ALB via Route 53 (optional).

### Deploying to Azure Container Apps / Web App for Containers

1. **Push Docker images** to Azure Container Registry.
2. **Create a Web App for Containers** (or Container App) from the Azure Portal.
3. **Set image source** to your ACR images for backend and frontend.
4. **Configure environment variables** in the Azure Portal.
5. **Assign custom domain and TLS** if needed.

> Note: Exact steps will vary per provider, but the core requirement is the same: run the Docker images (or `docker-compose` equivalent), supply the required environment variables, and expose the frontend over HTTP/HTTPS.

---

### 🧨 Testing

A dedicated `TEST` folder has been added to the project containing sample test cases. This folder is used to validate the functionality and working of the website.

**To run tests:**

1. Navigate to the TEST folder
2. Review the sample test cases provided
3. Execute the test cases against the application to verify correct PII detection and redaction
4. Ensure all detections match expected outputs

**Test Coverage:**

- Sample documents with various PII types
- Edge cases and special formatting
- Different document formats
- Performance validation

### Running Tests (Local Environment)

Use this script to validate the API from your local machine without Docker:

```bash
# From project root
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Backend must be running locally on http://localhost:8000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000 python run_tests.py
This will read all sample files from the TEST directory and print the /analyze, /mask, and /upload-pdf responses directly to your terminal.

Running Tests (Inside Docker)
Use this script when the application is running via Docker / Docker Compose:

```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up -d

# Enter the backend container
docker exec -it presidio-pii-detector-backend-1 bash

# Inside container
cd /app
python run_test_docker.py
run_tests.py is intended for local environment execution, while run_test_docker.py is designed to run inside the backend Docker container, using the same test data from the TEST folder and printing all results to the container’s command line for inspection.
---
```
🧩 Troubleshooting
------------------

If something is not working as expected, check the common issues below before opening an issue.

- **Frontend not loading / blank page**
  - Make sure Docker containers are running: `docker ps` (you should see both frontend and backend services).
  - Verify you are opening `http://localhost:80` in the browser when running via Docker Compose.

- **Backend API not reachable**
  - Open `http://localhost:8000/docs` to confirm the FastAPI server is up.
  - If it fails, check container logs: `docker-compose logs backend`.
  - Ensure no other service is already using port `8000`.

- **PII not being detected correctly**
  - Confirm the text is in English (multilingual detection is not yet supported).
  - For **Employee/Organization IDs**, only IDs starting with `ORG` (like `ORG12345`) are reliably detected right now.
  - For **Location**, only some common places are detected; many cities/localities are not yet recognized.

- **Docker build or start fails**
  - Run `docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans` and then `docker-compose up --build`.
  - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and updated to the latest stable versions.

- **PDF upload issues**
  - Verify the PDF is not password-protected or corrupted.
  - Check backend logs for PDF parsing errors (`pdfplumber` related messages).
  - - **Note on PDF Processing Limitations:** In PDF uploads, text highlighting functionality is currently not working. Only table extraction and JSON script output are available for PDF analysis. For highlighted text output, please use the direct text input feature instead.

If the problem persists, please [open an issue](https://github.com/KRAZATEC/Presidio-PII-Detector/issues) with logs, steps to reproduce, and sample input.

## 🚀 Future Upgrades

- **Multilinguality**: Support for detecting PII across multiple languages to make the tool accessible globally
- UI  Improvements: Enhanced dark mode, responsive design for mobile devices, improved user experience with better navigation and accessibility features
- **Expanded Location Detection**: Detection for all kinds of locations (cities, states, countries, full addresses, ZIP/postal codes, GPS coordinates, landmarks, facilities, and points of interest)
- **Custom Entity Rules**: UI and config support for user-defined regex rules, lookup-based entities, and context-aware custom PII types without code changes
- **Storage & Integrations**: Optional integration with object storage (S3, GCS), databases, and document sources like SharePoint, Google Drive, and S3 buckets
- Real-time detection dashboard
- API rate limiting and caching improvements

---

⚠️ What is Not Working
----------------------

Currently, there are no known critical issues. However, the following areas are known limitations and may need improvement:

- **Location Coverage**: `LOCATION` entity detection is limited to certain common place names and patterns. Many cities, localities, and less common addresses are not yet recognized, especially outside the currently tuned regions.
- Some edge cases in PII pattern matching may not be caught.
- Performance optimization for very large documents.
- Support for specialized PII formats from different regions.
